                Elephants are one of the most iconic animals in the world.<br>
                They have been a symbol of power in many cultures.Africans believe that if <br>
                one sees an Elephant in their dreams,it will bring rain.
                <br><br>
                in hinduism,Elephants are worshipped as Ganesha,a god who removes all obstacles.<br>
                Elephants have been an integral part of all major festivals in India and Sri Lanka.<br>
                <br>
                Elephants are masters of their Environment,They are known to eat medicinal plants to
                induce labour.<br>They are known to detect water from miles away from the low frequencies emmited.
                <br><br>
                Elephants are one of the most intelligent animals.<br>
                They display behaviours like stress,happiness,love and selflessness.<br>
                They comfort each other by hugging them with their trunks.<br>

            <b id="type">Scientific classification and distribution</b>
            <p >
                There are two types of Elephants-The asian Elephant and African Elephant.<br>
                The asian elephant Belongs to the genus "Elephas" and is the only species in it.<br>
                The asian Elephant is found from India in the west to Sumatra in the east.<br>
                The foothills of The Himalayas mark the species' northern limit.<br><br>
                The african Elephant is a genus of two species-The African Bush Elephant and The African Forest Elephant
                <br>
                The African Forest Elephant is found in the rainforests of central Africa and is smaller than the
                African Bush Elephant
                <br>
            </p>
            <b id="intelligence">Intelligence</b>
            <p >
                Elephants exhibit mirror self-recognition, an indication of self-awareness and cognition that has also been demonstrated in some apes and dolphins.<br> One study of a captive female Asian elephant suggested the animal was capable of learning and distinguishing between several visual and some acoustic discrimination pairs. This individual was even able to score a high accuracy rating when re-tested with the same visual pairs a year later.<br> Elephants are among the species known to use tools. An Asian elephant has been observed modifying branches and using them as flyswatters.<br> Tool modification by these animals is not as advanced as that of chimpanzees.<br> Elephants are popularly thought of as having an excellent memory. This could have a factual basis; they possibly have cognitive maps to allow them to remember large-scale spaces over long periods of time. 
                <br>Individuals appear to be able to keep track of the current location of their family members.
<br><br>
Scientists debate the extent to which elephants feel emotion. <br>
They appear to show interest in the bones of their own kind, regardless of whether they are related.
<br> As with chimps and dolphins, a dying or dead elephant may elicit attention and aid from others, 
including those from other groups. This has been interpreted as expressing "concern" however,
 others would dispute such an interpretation as being anthropomorphic;<br> the Oxford Companion
  to Animal Behaviour (1987) advised that "one is well advised to study the behaviour rather than <br>
  attempting to get at any underlying emotion".

            <p >
                African elephants were listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of 
              <br>  Nature (IUCN) in 2008, with no independent assessment of the conservation status of the two forms.<br>In 1979, Africa had an estimated minimum population of 1.3 million elephants, with a possible upper limit of 3.0 million. <br>By 1989, the population was estimated to be 609,000; with 277,000 in Central Africa, <br>110,000 in eastern Africa, 204,000 in southern Africa, and 19,000 in western Africa.<br> About 214,000 elephants were estimated to live in the rainforests, fewer than had previously been thought.<br> From 1977 to 1989, elephant populations declined by 74% in East Africa. 
                After 1987, losses in elephant numbers accelerated, and savannah populations from Cameroon to Somalia 
                experienced a decline of 80%. African forest elephants had a total loss of 43%. Population trends in 
                southern Africa were mixed, with anecdotal reports of losses in Zambia, Mozambique and Angola while 
                populations grew in Botswana and Zimbabwe and were stable in South Africa.<br> Conversely, 
                studies in 2005 and 2007 found populations in eastern and southern Africa were increasing
                 by an average annual rate of 4.0%.<br> Due to the vast areas involved, assessing the
                  total African elephant population remains difficult and involves an element of guesswork.<br><br> The IUCN estimates a total of around 440,000 individuals for 2012 while TRAFFIC estimates as many as 55 are poached daily.<br>
                <br>            <img src="img1.png" alt="Weapon" width="15%"><br>
African elephants receive at least some legal protection in every country where they are found, but 70% of their range exists outside protected areas.<br> Successful conservation efforts in certain areas have led to high population densities.<br> As of 2008, local numbers were controlled by contraception or translocation.<br> Large-scale cullings ceased in 1988, when Zimbabwe abandoned the practice. In 1989, the African elephant was listed under Appendix I by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), making trade illegal. Appendix II status (which allows restricted trade) was given to elephants in Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe in 1997 and South Africa in 2000. In some countries, sport hunting of the animals is legal; Botswana, Cameroon, Gabon, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe have CITES export quotas for elephant trophies. In June 2016, the First Lady of Kenya, Margaret Kenyatta, helped launch the East Africa Grass-Root Elephant Education Campaign Walk, organised by elephant conservationist Jim Nyamu. The event was conducted to raise awareness of the value of elephants and rhinos, to help mitigate human-elephant conflicts, and to promote anti-poaching activities.[144]

In 2008, the IUCN listed the Asian elephant as endangered due to a 50% population decline over the past 60–75 years while CITES lists the species under Appendix I.<br> 
Asian elephants once ranged from Syria and Iraq (the subspecies Elephas maximus asurus), 
to China (up to the Yellow River) and Java. It is now extinct in these areas,<br> and the 
current range of Asian elephants is highly fragmented.<br> The total population of Asian elephants
 is estimated to be around 40,000–50,000, although this may be a loose estimate.<br>I
 t is likely that around half of the population is in India. Although Asian elephants are 
 declining in numbers overall, particularly in Southeast Asia, the population in the Western
  Ghats appears to be increasing.

            <b id="conclution">Conclution</b>
                <p >
                    Elephants are a keystone species or an extremely important species.<br>
                    due to their huge size,They bring down trees.This helps light Enter the forest floor.<br>
                    This causes new growth and attracts many animals.
                    <br>Losing Elephants will adversely affect the population of many other animals.<br>
                    Elephants are huge seed dispersers.Without them,many Large seeded plants will cease to exist.
                    <br>Losing Elephants will mean losing one of The most intelligent and concious animals.
                    <br><br>
                    The best way to preserve elephants is to discourage ivory.<br>
                    Many tribes used to hunt Elephants for food.<br>
                    This practise was sustainable as most of the Elephant is used and sustains the people for many weeks.<br>
                    However,hunting for ivory has caused a decline in the population as most of the animal goes to waste and many Elephants
                    have to be killed to make ends meet for the hunters.<br>
